## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

---

[**PPEB**] is a fully integrated, all-in-one expansion solution for the TI-99/4A home computer.  
Built around the Raspberry Pi Pico W, it recreates multiple expansion cards and peripherals inside one modern sideport device:

- Speech Synthesizer (PWM Emulated)
- 32K RAM Expansion
- SAMS Memory (up to 8 MB on dual-PSRAM boards; 2 MB on single-PSRAM)
- Myarc RAM (512K)
- Cartridge GROM/GRAM loader
- Disk Controller with .DSK sector image support
- IDE Hard Disk Emulation via USB stick
- TIPI Extensions Compatibility
- USB Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick, Bluetooth HID support
- Math Co-Processor for accelerated floating-point math
- Digi-Port 8-bit audio output support
- RS232 Serial Support (physical 3.3 V UART on 2 MB boards; TCP/IP socket on all builds; physical not supported on 8 MB boards).
  
<br>

The PPEB project is built on the firmware and original hardware by **JasonACT** with hardware modifications by **dabone**, documentation by **hexbus**, community contributions via AtariAge, and extensive testing by numerous TI-99 enthusiasts.

## Safety Warnings <a name="safety-warnings"></a>

> **IMPORTANT ‚Äî READ BEFORE USING OR BUILDING:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never power the PPEB through USB while it is connected to your TI-99/4A.**  
  The device draws power directly from the TI sideport. USB power while inserted can cause hardware damage.
  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Always power down the TI-99/4A before inserting or removing the PPEB.**  
  Repeated insertion/removal while powered on can damage TI-99 side port buffer chips.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **The QI (Quality Improved) model of the TI-99/4A is not supported without hardware modifications.**  
  This is a TI motherboard limitation: QI units block GROM access on the side port, which is required for cartridge emulation.



- üõ† **Power Supply Stability:**  
  TI-99/4A power supply health is critical to PPEB stability.  
  Many random lockups have been traced to marginal regulators or aged power bricks.  
  If experiencing intermittent behavior, verify or recap your TI power supply.

# Firmware Installation <a name="firmware-installation"></a>

---

## üìã Overview

The PPEB uses custom firmware built for the Raspberry Pi Pico W, created by JasonACT and the AtariAge development community.

The firmware package includes:

- Main firmware UF2 image
- ROM packs
- DSR files
- Support files for SD card structure

You only need to flash the UF2 file once to load the firmware onto the Pico W.  
Future updates may simply involve replacing files on the MicroSD card.

---

## üóÉ Firmware Package Contents

[Latest August 7th beta firmware download here.](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/358129-pi-picow-peripheral-expansion-box-side-port-device/page/42/#findComment-5698588)

Download the `PPEB2.zip` unzip it, and you should have:

| File / Folder | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `PPEB2_2M.ino.uf2`     | Main firmware binary for 2MB Version (Single PSRAM Chip) |
| `PPEB2_8M.ino.uf2`     | Main firmware binary for 8MB Version (Dual PSRAM Chip) |
| `PPEB2_SID.ino.uf2`    | SID emulation for PPEB (version that needs extra Pico 1) |
| `PPEB2_SID_P2.ino.uf2` | SID emulation for PPEB (version that needs extra Pico 2) | 
| `/ROMS/` | ROM, Bins, and Blank disk files |

(**Note:**  You will use the SID firmware on the stand alone RPI Pico, and the PPEB_2M or PPEB_8M firmware on the actual PPEB.)

---

## üñ• Flashing Procedure for PPEB firmware 
### (also: steps 1 and 2 will work for the secondary SID Pico and its firmware)

> **‚ö† NOTE:** The Pico W must be flashed BEFORE inserting it into the TI-99/4A system!

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Pico W

- Do not have a MicroSD card inserted.
- Do not have anything plugged into the rear USB port.
- Hold down the **BOOTSEL** button on your Pico W.
- While holding the button, connect the Pico to your PC using a MicroUSB cable.
- The Pico should appear as a USB mass storage device named **RPI-RP2**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Flash UF2 Firmware

- Pick the Correct Firmware for your device - If you have 1 PSRAM, then select the 2MB version, 2 PSRAMs, select the 8MB version.
- Copy the file `PPEB.uf2` directly onto the Pico‚Äôs USB drive.  These files are only [located on AtariAge](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/358129-pi-picow-peripheral-expansion-box-side-port-device/page/28/#findComment-5639111).
- After the file copies, the Pico will automatically reboot into PPEB mode.

**Startup LED blink check**

- **3 blinks** ‚Üí No MicroSD card detected, or the SD card is missing required files. (Expected with no card.)
- **1 blink** ‚Üí Common observed behavior when a MicroSD card with the correct files is present. (Some builds may differ slightly.)

> ‚úÖ Firmware is now installed and ready for use.

---

## üîÑ Future Firmware Updates

- To update firmware:
  - Repeat this same UF2 flashing procedure.
  - No special erasure or prep needed.
- Updating firmware will not affect SD card contents or existing configuration.

---

## üõë Important Reminder

- NEVER power the Pico via USB when installed in the TI-99/4A sideport.
- All power should come from the TI sideport itself.

---

> ‚úÖ Firmware installed. Proceed to [SD Card Preparation ‚Üí](#sd-card-preparation)

---
# SD Card Preparation <a name="sd-card-preparation"></a>

---

## üìã Overview

The MicroSD card is absolutely essential to PPEB operation.  
The device will not function properly without a properly prepared SD card inserted.

This section provides a complete guide to:

- SD card formatting
- File structure
- File placement
- Common pitfalls

---

## üìÇ Supported Card Types

- Format: **FAT32 (MBR partitioning only)**
- Size: 8GB to 32GB recommended.
- Brand: Name-brand cards strongly recommended for compatibility (SanDisk, Samsung, Kingston, etc.).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT USE:

- exFAT format
- GPT partition tables
- Cards with manufacturer "quick formats"
- SDXC cards larger than 32GB (unless specially pre-formatted for FAT32)

---

## üßπ Clean Formatting (Highly Recommended)

### Windows (`diskpart` method)

1. Open **Command Prompt** (as Administrator)
2. Type:
    ```
    diskpart
    list disk
    select disk # (your SD card number)
    clean
    create partition primary
    format fs=fat32 quick
    assign
    exit
    ```

### macOS/Linux

- Use **Disk Utility** or `gparted`:
  - Partition table: MBR (Master Boot Record)
  - Format: MS-DOS FAT32

---

## üìÇ SD Card File Structure

Be sure to get the matching DSR.ROM that matches your firmware. Or just download the latest and reflash your PPEB.

[Latest beta firmware download here.](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/358129-pi-picow-peripheral-expansion-box-side-port-device/page/35/#findComment-5680418)


Your SD card root should contain the at least the following folders and files.  
These files are in the firmware package in the roms directory.  
(You will have to create your own autoload.cfg of download the sample card image below that has a barebones file in it)

The easiest way to do this is just copy the content of the roms directory to the root of your SD card.

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ autoload.cfg           <-- Main configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DSR.ROM                <-- MAIN DSR.ROM (REQUIRED!!!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DISK.ROM               <-- Needed for Disk Emulation. 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PICOPEBG.BIN           <-- This the PPEBMenu that can be autostarted with the cart option in autoload.cfg

Optional

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PCode.GRM              <-- Needed for PCODE Card Emulation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PCode.ROM              <-- Needed for PCODE Card Emulation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BLNK.DSK               <-- Blank Disk Image

```

> P-CODE files must be in the SD card root.  
> `PCode.ROM` = 12 KB, `PCode.GRM` = 62‚Äì64 KB.


 A sample card image can be found here. [Download Sample Card Image](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/358129-pi-picow-peripheral-expansion-box-side-port-device/page/28/#findComment-5616188).

Just unzip it to the root of your SD card. If you have done this correctly you will have the following also appear in the root of the SD card.



```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ autoload.cfg           <-- Main configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BLNK.DSK               <-- Blank RAM disk image (optional)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Development            <-- Programming Tools ROMs folder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Educational            <-- Educational Programs and Games folder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Games                  <-- Games folder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Homebrew               <-- Homebrew Games
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tools                  <-- TI Tools (Disk Manager, etc) folder
```

## üìÇ Sample `autoload.cfg` 

A basic starting configuration file may look like this:

```
CRU=1
PCODE=0
BAUD=9600
WIFI=YourSSID
PASS=YourWiFiPassword
SNTP=pool.ntp.org
TZHR=-5
TZMN=0
D1MAP=/BLNK.DSK
CART=/PICOPEB
RESET=1
```

> A full list of all supported configuration fields will be documented in the [Configuration Reference](#configuration-file-reference-autoloadcfg).

---

## üß™ Validate Card Preparation

Before first use:

- Insert SD card into the fully assembled PPEB unit.
- Apply power to TI-99/4A.
- If `autoload.cfg` is valid, the PPEB will initialize automatically.
- Improper SD formatting is one of the most common causes of boot failure.

---

# Configuration File Reference (`autoload.cfg`) <a name="configuration-file-reference-autoloadcfg"></a>

---

## üìã Overview

The `autoload.cfg` file controls nearly all PPEB operating parameters.  
It is read at startup from the **root directory** of the SD card.

This section documents **all supported configuration fields**, derived directly from the firmware source (`PPEB2.ino`) and AtariAge thread discussions.
___
 
**Automatic Loading of PPEB Menu from the TI Boot Screen**

Place **PICOPEBG.BIN** on the **root** of the SD card, then add this to `autoload.cfg`:

```ini
CART=/PICOPEB
```
If you have the reset button installed or a PPEB-cr version, then also add RESET=1 to allow returning to the PPEB menu with the reset button.
(I think this is incompatible with a rs232 adapter installed,
<br> I've not tested the rs232 function)

> Note: On **single-PSRAM (2 MB)** builds, using the physical 3.3 V UART conflicts with the RESET-on-GPIO8 option. If you wire the UART, remove `RESET=1`.

---

### üìÇ File Format

- File name: `autoload.cfg`
- Format: Plain text (ASCII)
- One setting per line: `KEY=VALUE`
- No quotes needed around values
- Blank lines and comment lines (starting with `#`) are allowed

Example:

```ini
CRU=1
WIFI=MyWiFi
PASS=SuperSecret
SNTP=pool.ntp.org
```

# IDE and USB Storage Setup <a name="ide-and-usb-storage-setup"></a>

---

## üìã Overview

The PPEB supports IDE hard disk emulation through the use of USB storage devices.  
Unlike floppy disk image support (which uses the MicroSD), IDE emulation works **only via USB**.

The IDE emulation replicates Myarc-style hard disk functionality for compatible TI disk managers and OS environments.


  ## [Click Here For How to Install the IDEDSR to the PPEB](/idedsr.md)
  
---

## üñß Hardware Notes

- IDE images must be stored on a USB memory stick attached to the PPEB.
- The Pico W enumerates the USB drive automatically on startup.
- You may use a powered USB hub to allow multiple USB devices simultaneously (keyboard, mouse, joystick, USB drive).

---

## üìÇ File Structure on USB

Format the USB drive **exFAT** (recommended). RAW devices are also supported; FAT32 has worked in some tests.

> Note: The **MicroSD** card used for the PPEB must be FAT32 (MBR). The **USB** drive used for IDE images can be exFAT (recommended) or RAW; FAT32 has also worked in tests.

```bash
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ harddisk1.dat      <-- IDE drive 1 image
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ harddisk2.dat      <-- IDE drive 2 image (optional)
```

- Subdirectories are not recommended.
- Image files are raw sector dumps, not filesystem dumps.
- File sizes up to ~2GB per image supported.   Large images have been tested; for reliability keep each image ‚â§ ~2 GB.
- Images may contain multiple partitions, formatted using Myarc HD utilities.

---

## üîß Enabling IDE in `autoload.cfg`

Example configuration:

```ini
IDE=1
HARDDISK1=harddisk1.dat
HARDDISK2=harddisk2.dat
```

- `IDE=1` activates IDE functionality.
- Filenames must match exactly (case-sensitive).

## Minimal `autoload.cfg` for IDE testing

```ini
CART=/PICOPEB
IDE=1
HARDDISK1=harddisk1.dat
```

---

## üß∞ IDE Image Preparation

- IDE images may be created via:

  - Myarc utilities (real hardware or emulator)
  - MAME or Classic99 IDE tools
  - Raw image creation utilities (Linux `dd` or Windows disk image tools)

- Images may contain one or more TI partitions depending on tool used.

- It is strongly recommended to build IDE images on emulator or PC before transferring to USB.

- [Link to Hexbus's IDE Guide](https://hexbus.com/ti99geek/Projects/idedsr/idedsr.html#idedsr)

---

## ‚ö† Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| TI99 Hanging on Boot|USB Formatted as FAT32|Format USB as exFAT
| IDE not detected | USB drive not seen | Try different hub port |
| Hard disk not formatted | Blank image used | Use Myarc utilities to initialize |
| Image too large | Unsupported file size | Keep images ‚â§ 2GB |

- Some USB hubs enumerate devices in varying orders ‚Äî try swapping ports if devices conflict.
- Always eject USB drive safely from PC before inserting into PPEB.

---

## üìù Notes

- The IDE interface works fully in conjunction with TIPI, SAMS, Myarc RAM, and DSR functions.
- Only one USB memory stick may be used for IDE storage per session.
- The USB drive is hot-plug capable only if properly unmounted beforehand.

---

# Advanced Features <a name="advanced-features"></a>

---

## üìã Overview

The PPEB replicates ‚Äî and in many cases expands ‚Äî multiple classic TI expansion subsystems inside one sideport device.

This section summarizes each advanced subsystem available once fully configured.

---

## üîß SAMS Memory Expansion

- Fully supports 1MB or 8MB SAMS configurations.
  - On dual-PSRAM boards, SAMS paging up to **8 MB** is supported and has been exercised in demos/utilities; single-PSRAM boards support **2 MB**.
Notes:
  - Most classic software was written for ‚â§1 MB, but newer builds/demos use >1 MB.
  - PPEB firmware and tooling have examples showing 8 MB setups working on dual-PSRAM boards.
   
- Uses external PSRAM modules connected to Pico W.
- Activated automatically when present.
- SAMS memory functions as expanded RAM for compatible software.
- Works with Geneve emulation, FinalGROM99, RXB, Myarc DOS, UCSD PCode, etc.

---

## üîß Myarc RAM Emulation (512KB)

- Emulates Myarc 512KB RAM card for compatible software.
- Swaps SAMS space dynamically to operate within Myarc RAM specifications.

# Appendix B ‚Äî Memory Tester Usage <a name="appendix-b--memory-tester-usage"></a>

---

## üìã Overview

The PPEB uses external PSRAM modules to enable SAMS and advanced memory features.

Because PSRAM chips can vary significantly in timing tolerance, JasonACT developed a standalone memory test utility to validate stable operation at specific Pico clock speeds.

---

## üíæ Tool Provided

- File: `memtest2.uf2` - Locate the latest memory test on [this thread](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/358129-pi-picow-peripheral-expansion-box-side-port-device/) on AtariAge
- Delivered as: `*.memtest2.ino.uf2.zip` (extract before use)

This is a standalone firmware image that runs on the Pico W outside of PPEB firmware.

---

## üñ• Flashing Procedure

1. Disconnect Pico W from PPEB board (or flash prior to full assembly).
2. Connect Pico W to PC via MicroUSB while holding **BOOTSEL** button.
3. Copy the latest version of `memtest2.uf2` as linked above to the Pico W mass storage device (`RPI-RP2`).
4. Pico will reboot into the memory tester.

> ‚ö† This test runs *without* the TI-99/4A attached.

---

## üß™ Memory Test Tool Behavior

- The Pico W will attempt repeated full PSRAM memory tests.
- If an error occurs, onboard LED will flash blink codes indicating failure.

**Startup LED blink check (normal behavior):**

| LED Blink Pattern | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|
| Constant solid | Test running, no errors |
| Flashing pattern | Memory failure detected |

- Each failure pattern identifies which test stage failed.

- The test runs continuously to catch intermittent errors caused by marginal chips or thermal changes.

### üîß Adjusting Pico Timing if errors detected

If memory errors are detected, you may tune firmware timing via `autoload.cfg`:

```ini
MHZ=258
NOPS=5
NOPSW=5
```

- Lower `MHZ` values slow Pico clock speed for stability.
- `NOPS` and `NOPSW` introduce deliberate read/write delays.
- Use the memory test tool after adjustments to confirm stability before flashing final PPEB firmware.

---

### üìù Test Recommendations

- Run for several minutes to verify no errors under thermal load.
- Perform test after full PCB assembly to account for solder joint quality.
- Use known-good name-brand PSRAM chips whenever possible.

---

### Return the unit back to regular firmware when done

- Ensure you flash the regular PPEB firmware back to the unit after completing the memory test.
